# dooropener-telegram
A client for [door-dumb-api](https://codeberg.org/peprolinbot/door-dumb-api) that allows to use a Telegram bot to simply open the door. The bot used to do a few more things (check the `old` branch if interested), but if you want anything more advanced, you should check [Home assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) as this is meant to be extremly simple (I run it at my grandparents' country house, where there are limited resources).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATION NOTICE
I no longer used this (altough it should still work, but keep in mind this was developed when I was 13 and poorly patched over the years) and therefore i will not update it (I seriously doubt anyone would want to use this, but feel free to fork). My grandparents bought a new door opener and now there is  fiber at the house, so **we now use** Home Assistant and [tg-ha-door](https://github.com/peprolinbot/tg-ha-door). 

## üîß Deploy it 

###  üê≥ With Docker (Recommended)

This is quick, easy and simple (if everything is going to be on a Pi, you should make yourself a `docker-compose.yml`):

1. First, you need a [door-dumb-api](https://codeberg.org/peprolinbot/door-dumb-api) instance. Check that README to learn how to spin one up

2. Then, you can setup the basic configuration (check `config.example.json`).

3. Then you can use this docker command:
```bash
docker run -d --name dooropener-telegram -v /tmp/config:/app/config ghcr.io/peprolinbot/dooropener-telegram
```
